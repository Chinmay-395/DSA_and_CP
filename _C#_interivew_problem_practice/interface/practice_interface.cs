/*
What is an interface?
游릭 an interface is a way to achieve abstraction in C#
游릭 An interface is a completely "abstract class", which 
   can only contain abstract methods and properties (with empty bodies)
        Just like classes interfaces also contains properties, methods, delegates or events, 
        but only declarations and no implementation.
        doesn't allow to create an instance of an interface
        Interface in C# is a blueprint of a class.

游뛀NOTE:
    游릴 If a class or a struct inherits from an interface, it must provide implmentation 
       for all interface members. Otherwise, we get a compiler error.
    游릴 Interfaces can inherit from other interfaces. A class that inherits this interface must provide
        implementation for all interface members in the entire interface inheritance chain.       
    游릴 we cannot create an instance of an Interface, but an interface refernce variable can point
        to a derived class object.
