/*
What is heap?
A complete binary tree that satisfies heap's property

What is heap's property?

Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest
among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be
recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum
among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must
be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
