# Interview prep Coding Practice Questions

|Sr.No|Name|Question|Insight/Solution|Strategy|
|----|----|--------|----------------|--------|
|1|Two Sum|Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.|Use hashmap to see if the number's complement exists|-|
|2|Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits|Given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits|create a counter and check for even number in the array by `num%2==0`|-|
|3|peek finding|<p>Problem description: A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors. <br/>Given an input array nums, where `nums[i] â‰  nums[i+1]`, find a peak element and return its index.<br/>The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.</p>|using binary search method reduce the the size of array|pointers on either side|
|3|reverse integer|<p>Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0 <span style="color:#5AD3C6">Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).</span></p>|||
