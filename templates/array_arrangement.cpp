/*
If there are two arrays arr1 & arr2 in the problem and
I need to arrange the order of arr1 according to arr2 such that
arr2 is in increasing order,
For Eg:-

arr1=[5,6,4,1,7]
arr2=[3,0,2,3,1]

arranging the arr2 in an increasing order
arr2=[0,1,2,3,3]

therefore arr1 = [6,7,4,5,1] (if the numbers in arr2 are same, order in which they were inserted is maintained for arr1)

then do the following:-
